A exploration in using AI in Product Design, specifically for Industrial Designers.

---

Design and development processes are inherently iterative and structured, aiming to balance creativity, functionality, and feasibility. In this paper, we propose that an Industrial Design (ID) or Product Development (PD) project generally progresses through eight well-defined phases. 

This paper focuses on the role of genAI in the early stages of the ID/PD process, specifically Research and Discovery, Concept Ideation, and Preliminary Design. 

These foundational phases are critical because they shape the trajectory of the entire project, laying the groundwork for innovative and effective solutions. 

By exploring how genAI supports these phases, we aim to highlight its potential to streamline workflows, enhance creativity, and inform data-driven decision-making in the design and development process.
